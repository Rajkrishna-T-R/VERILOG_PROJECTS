--PLEASE VISIT THE BELOW MENTIONED BRANCH FOR VERILOG MODULES--


BRANCH IN WHICH THE FILES IS GIVEN 

"DIGITAL_CLOCK_FPGA"









-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Me and my friends have modeled a Digital clock in verilog which is synthesized and tested in FPGA board.
This repo contains the branch which will have all the verilog files we created.
