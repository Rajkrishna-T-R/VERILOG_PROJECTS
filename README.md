This repo is about my first FPGA project which i have done in my semester-3 of B Tech degree.
  
This repo contain verliog description of  basic digital clock with time setting feature.
  
This repo contains all the verilog modules for making a synthesizable design of a digital clock in FPGA.

I used boolean board xc7s50csga324-1 and xc7s50csga324-2 for running this design.


People who worked along with me are Neha Fathima S and Sree Vishnu Vardhan
